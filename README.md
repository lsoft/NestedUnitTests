# NestedUnitTests

What's about to move your unit tests closer to the code?

## How to try

- Create a new class library for netcore or net5/6 (with SDK style csproj)
- Click RMB on project node in Solution Explorer and choose [Prepare project for nested unit tests](1.png)
- Click RMB on C# file node in Solution Explorer and choose [Add unit tests](2.png)
- New C# file with the unit test can now be opened under the file you choosed.

[You can also set this Vsix up](3.png)

This is a very early version of the vsix!
